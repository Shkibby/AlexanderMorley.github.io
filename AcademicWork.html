							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/IMG_09.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>During my undergraduate studies, I lead a team of four undergraduate electronic engineers, to develop the design specifications and wiring diagrams that supported the fabrication of an autonomous robot system. 
							The robot was implemented with a PID controller for differential drive, whilst using the on board sensors designed by the group, to follow a white line in an unpredictable environment.</p>
							<p>Such as the path show in the image above, provided by the  <a href="https://www.mub.eps.manchester.ac.uk/eee/2019/09/23/reviewing-the-2nd-year-embedded-systems-project/">University of Manchester</a>.</p>

							<span class="image"><img src="images/IMG_13.png" alt="" /></span>
							<span class="image"><img src="images/IMG_12.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>For undergradate dissertation, I created a unique method of implementing impedance control, into the new CoppeliaSim simulation that integrated the MujoCo soft bodies physics engine. This allowed me to emulate 
							one degree of freedom robotic arm with an antagonisitic cable actauted joint. The goal of the project was to push the limits of this new software whilst developing an impedance control system.
							</p>

							
							<p>The robot arm was simualted to statically hold a neutral position of 45 degrees, and would return to this position after any force injection that would cause an oscillatory response.</p>

							<p>To compare the accuracy of the simulation, a physical prototype of the envisioned model was built that implemented a differential position controller.</p>
